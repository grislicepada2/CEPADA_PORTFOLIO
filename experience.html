                        Through the years, I’ve learned to express my creativity with confidence and grace.
                        Joining art competitions helped me grow not only in skill but also in patience, humility,
                        and self-discipline. Every contest, whether I won or not, taught me something valuable about
                        effort, improvement, and believing in what I can create.

                            <p>Joined the festival’s Coffee Art contest, where I showcased my creativity using coffee as
                                a medium — a
                                fun and unique experience that challenged my artistic techniques.</p>
